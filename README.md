# ObserverPattern

This solution is a C# example of the observer pattern, created by following the Head First Design Patterns book.
as well as following Christopher Okhravi's Youtube explanation of the same book https://youtu.be/_BpmfnqjgzQ?si=Nq5rU04s8cVT1T30.

Please note: This solution is simply an example of how the Observer Pattern could be implemented. It simulates a change and is not 
a fully functioning weather application.
